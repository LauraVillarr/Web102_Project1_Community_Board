## Notes

I initially had some issues getting the components set up and displaying, as initially they were not displaying on the screen.
I then had issues getting my cards to work properly with flexbox, but with some configuring of css properties and thinking in terms of parent and child
components I was able to get it working.
Finally, it took me a while to compile all the data used for this app, as well as making sure the images on each card looked as consistently sized as possible
relative to each other. I had to put constraints on both the width and height of the image to achieve the result that I wanted.
